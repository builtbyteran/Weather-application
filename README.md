# Weather Forecast App

A clean, responsive weather application that displays current conditions and a 5-day forecast for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Features

- Current weather conditions with temperature and description
- 5-day forecast with daily high temperatures
- Responsive design (mobile and desktop)
- Real-time data from OpenWeatherMap API
- Clean, minimal interface

## Technologies

- JavaScript
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap 5
- OpenWeatherMap API
- Google Fonts (Montserrat)

## What I Learned

- Working with external APIs and data fetching
- DOM manipulation and dynamic content rendering
- Responsive design with Bootstrap grid system
- Date formatting with Intl.DateTimeFormat
- Managing API keys with config files

## Future Enhancements

- After a user has searched a city (and that city's weather information is currently displaying), the user should see a "Set as Default" button. When the user clicks this button, there should be some indication that the current city is set as their default city. If the user refreshes the page, instead of a blank screen and search bar, their default city's info should come up.
- Add a button to the interface that will allow the user to automatically look up their current location using the Geolocation API
- Alter the styling based on the weather type to give the user a different experience based on the weather of their selected city
- Place a map on the page with the current location shown using the Google Maps Embed API
- Add in nearby cities to the map with the current temperature and weather shown on the map "pin" and let them click a "pin" to switch to that city's weather.

## Weather Project

This project has been created by a student at Parsity, an online software engineering course. The work in this repository is wholly of the student based on a sample starter project that can be accessed by looking at the repository that this project forks.
